# Dialogue-Utility-Artificial-Intelligence-System

The Dialogue Utility AI System Package is a Unity tool for providing game developers with the scripts and tools to build their own interesting NPCs and/or dialogue. It is a combined dialogue system and an AI utility (actions have assigned values for actions based on the outcomes of those actions â€“ highest value is prioritised) system tool for Unity game developers, saving time from dealing with AI and dialogue programming for small conversations in games. It also allows the developer to provide emotion to NPCs by having their needs affect their emotion, in addition to player dialogue choices. This allows for more life-like characters by allowing them to make decisions based on what they feel rather than evaluating purely for their needs.
